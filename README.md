# Voice-Control-RC-Car
PIS Endsem Project - Arduino Based
![F1 Prototype ] https://github.com/pendi1901/Voice-Control-RC-Car/blob/main/PIS1.jpeg?raw=true
Concept:
An F1 Car made from reinforced Cardboard and Motors, Battery Packs and many more components.
Design Inspiration: Mercedes W12- Silver Arrow
This is a Voice Controlled Car where we had programmed 4 commands to perform the respective actions:
"FORWARD" - Instructs the car to move forwards.
"BACK" - Instructs the car to move backwards.
"RIGHT" - Instructs the car to move to the right.
"LEFT" - Instructs the car to move to the left.
 There's a steering mechanism in place to facilitate the RIGHT and LEFT movements.
 We've used 2: 20V - DC Motors as the Chassis was pretty heavy and we needed powerful motors to keep the car moving.
 Bluetooth Module connected the App on the phone with the whole Arduino system where we had the input Voice commands.
 UltraSonic sensors we're also installed to keep the car from colliding if the car got too close to an obstacle.
 To power the powerful DC motors we installed 2 battery packs which were 15V each.
