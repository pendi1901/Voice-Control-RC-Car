# Voice-Control-RC-Car
## PIS Endsem Project - Arduino Based Project
![ F1 Prototype ](PIS2.jpeg)
## Concept:
- An F1 Car made from reinforced Cardboard and Motors, Battery Packs and many more components.
- Design Inspiration: Mercedes W12- Silver Arrow
## Working
This is a Voice Controlled Car where we had programmed 4 commands to perform the respective actions:
* **"FORWARD"** - Instructs the car to move forwards.
* **"BACK"** - Instructs the car to move backwards.
* **"RIGHT"** - Instructs the car to move to the right.
* **"LEFT"** - Instructs the car to move to the left.
There's a steering mechanism in place to facilitate the RIGHT and LEFT movements.
## Stuff we've used:
- We've used 2: 20V - DC Motors as the Chassis was pretty heavy and we needed powerful motors to keep the car moving.
- Bluetooth Module connected the App on the phone with the whole Arduino system where we had the input Voice commands.
- UltraSonic sensors we're also installed to keep the car from colliding if the car got too close to an obstacle.
- To power the powerful DC motors we installed 2 battery packs which were 15V each.
## Installation
- Install Arduino locally.
-  Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pendi1901/Voice-Control-RC-Car.git
   ```
